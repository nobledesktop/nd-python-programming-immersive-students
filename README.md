# Python Programming Immersive

## Using VSCode

If you don't already have VS Code you may install it via their download link:
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

VS Code is a program for editing code with a suite of tools designed to make development easier and faster.

Once you have VS Code downloaded, you may either clone or download this repository by clicking the green `<> Code` button. For those unfamiliar with GitHub you may click the `Download ZIP` button.

Once you have this repository on your computer, open it with VS Code.

## Using the Terminal

We will utilize the terminal for this class. To open the terminal in VS Code look for the `Terminal` tab (generally after `File`, `Edit`, etc.). Select `New Terminal`. This will open a terminal window with a command prompt.

## Using Python

Check that you have Python installed:

```bash
# open a new terminal

python --version

# OR

python3 --version
```

If you receive a Python version number for example `Python 3.8.13` then congratulations, you're good to go!

If your terminal gave you an error then please search for and follow the instructions for your OS to download Python onto your computer.

## Running Python

Using the Python REPL:

```bash
# open a new terminal

python

# OR

python3
```

Running Python files using the terminal:

```bash
# open a new terminal

python filename.py

# OR

python3 filename.py
```

Running a python file and then going into a REPL:

```bash
# open a new terminal

python -i filename.py

# OR

python3 -i filename.py
```
